DATE/TIME: Thursday, February 27, 2026 — 14:55 PST
TASK: Y2K Neo-Brutalist Theme Overhaul — website/
AUTHOR: AI Assistant
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Rethemed the ShipCruiseTour PHP website (website/) with a Y2K black-and-white
neo-brutalist aesthetic. Strict #000/#fff palette, boxy squared elements, thick
hard-offset borders, and heavy CSS animations throughout. No PHP business logic
or routing was modified.

FILES MODIFIED
--------------
1. website/public/css/style.css
   - Replaced all Google Fonts imports with Space Mono + VT323 (from Google Fonts CDN).
   - Swapped entire color palette to pure black (#000) / white (#fff).
   - All border-radius values set to 0 (boxy/squared everywhere).
   - Buttons: border 2-3px solid, hard box-shadow 4px 4px 0 #000, active state
     translates by (3-4px, 3-4px) and removes shadow (neo-brut press effect).
   - Added full @keyframes library:
       glitch / glitch-layer  — hero heading clip-path glitch animation
       flicker                — CRT brightness pulse (body, 8s loop)
       scanlines              — fixed pseudo-element scanline overlay (body::before)
       marquee                — used in CTA section ticker and .y2k-marquee-strip
       fadeInUp / fadeInLeft  — stagger entrance animations
       borderPulse            — animated box-shadow for hover states
       blink                  — cursor blink utility
       move-forever           — waves animation (unchanged)
       animateWaves / animate — wave background animations (unchanged)
   - Counter section: black background, white VT323 numbers, monospace labels.
   - CTA section: full black background, embedded CSS marquee text strip at top.
   - Search form: thick black border + 6px 6px hard shadow, squared corners.
   - Swiper pagination bullets: flat rectangles (width:20px, height:4px).
   - Added .y2k-marquee-strip / .y2k-marquee-inner classes for JS-injected ticker.
   - All images: filter: grayscale(1) applied site-wide where applicable.
   - Generic .card, .btn, .form-control Bootstrap overrides to enforce B&W theme.

2. website/public/css/card.css
   - Cruise cards (#cruisesBox): squared corners, 2px border, 4px 4px 0 #000 shadow.
     Hover: shadow expands to 8px, card lifts via translate(-2px, -2px).
     Active: translate(3px, 3px) neo-brut press.
   - Cruise detail modal (#cruisesDetail): white background, 3px border + 8px shadow.
   - Room type radio labels: squared, black border, checked = black fill / white text.
   - Pagination buttons: squared, 2px border, 2px shadow, active = black fill.
   - .btn-reservation: B&W neo-brutalist style, press animation.

3. website/public/css/footer.css
   - Footer background: solid #000 (was blue gradient).
   - All text: #fff / #aaa (was various blues).
   - Footer newsletter strip: white background, 3px border, 5px 5px 0 #000 shadow.
   - Social links: white squares with black icons, hover inverts.
   - Section headings: VT323 monospace, uppercase, letter-spaced.
   - Wave decorations: filter: grayscale(1).

4. website/public/css/contact.css
   - Contact heading: VT323, uppercase, letter-spaced.
   - .contact-wrap: 3px border + 8px 8px 0 #000 shadow.
   - Contact info panel: black background, white/gray text.
   - Form labels: Space Mono, uppercase.
   - Error/success messages: neo-brutalist box style.

5. website/app/views/component/user/header.php
   - Added Google Fonts preconnect for Space Mono + VT323.
   - Removed redundant Comfortaa / Open Sans imports (now in style.css).
   - Removed navbar-dark class and style="opacity:95%" inline override.
   - Removed text-white inline class from all .nav-link elements (CSS controls color).
   - Login link: removed text-white class.

6. website/app/views/component/admin/header.php
   - Added Space Mono + VT323 Google Fonts link.

7. website/app/views/connection/login.php
   - Full visual overhaul: login card uses neo-brutalist box style (3px border,
     8px 8px 0 #000 shadow).
   - VT323 title "Login_" with blinking cursor feel.
   - Form inputs: squared, thick border, hard shadow.
   - Submit button: neo-brutalist press animation.
   - Login illustration: filter: grayscale(1) + border + shadow.
   - Removed all inline teal/rounded styles.

DESIGN DECISIONS
----------------
- Pure B&W (no grays except #333/#555/#aaa for subtle depth). Zero color anywhere.
- VT323 used for all headings/display text; Space Mono for body/labels/buttons.
- All interactive elements have a neo-brutalist "press" animation: active state
  translates by (3-4px) and removes the hard shadow, mimicking physical button press.
- CRT scanline overlay uses body::before with a fixed repeating-linear-gradient.
- Flicker animation on <body> at 8s interval for authentic Y2K CRT monitor feel.
- Marquee animations used in both the CTA section (CSS pseudo-element) and the
  .y2k-marquee-strip helper class for any JS-injected ticker strips.
- All images across the site get filter: grayscale(1) via targeted CSS to stay in
  pure B&W palette without modifying markup or PHP.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
----------------------
- All PHP routes, database queries, session logic, and URL structures are untouched.
- Bootstrap grid classes are preserved; only visual/color properties overridden.
- AOS scroll library retained; its animated elements now use B&W transitions.
- Swiper slider retained; navigation bullets restyled to flat B&W rectangles.
