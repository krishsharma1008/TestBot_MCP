2025-03-02 (Codebase Understanding and Cleanup Plan implementation)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- .gitignore: Removed merge conflict markers. Uncommented and added ignores for
  test-results/, playwright-report/, testbot-reports/. Added .claude/ to IDE
  section. Kept node_modules, .env*, .idea, .vscode, OS/log patterns.

- Removed generated artifacts from repo: Stopped tracking and deleted from
  working tree: testbot-reports/ (root), examples/ (entire directory including
  sample-project playwright-report, test-results, testbot-reports). These paths
  are now in .gitignore so they are not re-committed.

- testbot-mcp/src/report-generator.js: In copyPlaywrightHTMLReport(), removed
  the candidate paths for examples/sample-project and sample-project; only
  projectPath/playwright-report is used now (examples/ was removed).

- README.md: Rewrote to describe MCP + webapp layout. Removed references to
  deleted docs (AI_AGENT_QUICKSTART.md, AI_AGENT_README.md, etc.) and broken
  image paths (website/public/asset/). Added Quick start for dashboard, MCP,
  and Playwright. Kept project context/criteria section without images.

- package.json: Set description to "QA testing POC with Testbot MCP and
  dashboard webapp" (replaced invalid markdown image syntax and missing path).

Target structure: root config (.env.example, .gitignore, .mcp.json,
docker-compose.yml, package.json, playwright.config.js, README.md), testbot-mcp/,
tests/, webapp/. No testbot-reports, playwright-report, test-results, or
examples/ in the repo.
