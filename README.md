A room is characterized by (ship, room number, type of
room [solo room, room for 2 people, family room more than 2 people and less than 6], price (depending on the type of
room), capacity according to the type of room )

A reservation is characterized by (customer, cruise, ++reservation date++, ++reservation price++, room).

A reservation concerns a single cruise and a single client.

For Frontend development (Html, css frameworks, js, sass (optional)), choose the css framework that you know best.

Validation of fields as well as pagination in the application must be carried out with the Javascript language.

​

Bonuses:

​

Ticket printing.

Display of statistics (total number of cruises, number of cruises per month, total customers, number of countries,
graphic charter (port/cruise) ...) in the admin area.
